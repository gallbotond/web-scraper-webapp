This repo contains the source code for a web application, which let's users use the data of a mongodb database populated by a web scraper I wrote in python. The database will contain weekly updated product price and other information. I plan to let users schedule jobs for the web scraper too. 
This is a work in progress, I'm currently working on the user authentication backend.  

For the frontend I'm using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), which is a React like framework, but with some improvements and different approaches. The backend is in [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and communicates with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database
